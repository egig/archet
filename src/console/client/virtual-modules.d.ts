// Declares brand-new ambient modules (not augmentations of real ones) — that only works from a
// file with no top-level import/export of its own (a "global" .d.ts), which is the entire reason
// these live in their own file instead of alongside the (very similar) __CONSOLE_PATH__ /
// __CONSOLE_BRAND__ declarations in env.d.ts: that file's top-level `import type` (needed for
// `ConsoleBrandConfig`) makes it a module, and a `declare module '...'` block placed there would
// only be visible within env.d.ts itself, not from `main.tsx`/`fields.tsx`.
